**The Compass Score – how it works**

Nirvana is a neutral search engine for finance. Set a search query \- about a product, a mix of products, a loss limit, a sector, a theme, anything \- and we return results. Every result shows a search relevance score \- the Compass Score (on a scale from 0–10,000) for how closely the result matches your search. Identical inputs produce identical outputs. There are no paid placements.

**The flow in plain English**

**Set a search query in your own words.** Tell us what you want to search for, or choose settings such as a loss limit, time horizon, sectors, or exclusions. 

**We search: Proximity** is Nirvana’s **search and ranking engine**. It takes your parameters and searches the entire eligible universe of products. 

**We apply the Nirvana Standard:**  The Nirvana Standard is an internal eligibility screen. It is impersonal and not a recommendation or suitability assessment, and it does not consider any person’s financial circumstances. Only items that pass the proprietary gate are considered; the rest are excluded. 

**We score and rank:** Each eligible item gets a **Compass Score (0 – 10,000)** \- reflecting how relevant the item is to the search query. Results are ordered strictly by the Compass Score. 

**Search-engine analogy:** Like a web search engine, Proximity ranks matches using internal relevance signals. Web search engines maintain internal numeric relevance scores (for example, Google’s PageRank era scores and successors) but do not display them. **Nirvana makes the relevance explicit by showing the Compass Score for each eligible result.**  

**Sur \- Optional sample mix.** When invoked by you, Sur shows a rules-based sample mix surfaced from the same search settings so you can compare quality of search relevance of a combination of search results with single results. 

**Review, compare, and discuss:** Use the Compass Scores to shortlist options, adjust your settings, and discuss the list with your adviser to build from the ground up around your loss boundary. 

**What the Compass Score is \- and is not**

* **Is:**  search-based relevance measure for your current search. Change the settings (for example, a stricter loss limit) and the product list and their Compass Scores update. 


* **Is not:** investment advice, a personal recommendation, an assessment of suitability, or a prediction of future outcomes. 

**Why this helps**

  **Comparable, numeric relevance** – every eligible search result carries a Compass Score from 0 to 10,000. Scores are shown in 50-point increments and the minimum visible score is 6,500.

  **Noise removed** – the Nirvana Standard excludes items that do not meet our internal criteria, so you compare from a cleaner, eligible set.

  **Deterministic and neutral** – identical inputs produce identical outputs, with no paid placements.

  **Useful for real conversations** – the list and Scores give you a concrete starting point to discuss with your adviser and to refine your settings.

  **Your choice of execution** – if you choose to transact, you do so with third-party providers outside Nirvana.
