**Nirvana Member End User Licence Agreement (EULA)**

**Effective Date:** *26 August 2025*

This End User Licence Agreement (“EULA” or “Agreement”) is a binding legal contract between you (the Member) and Nirvana X Limited (“Nirvana,” “we,” or “us”). By selecting “Agree and subscribe” or equivalent and creating an account, you (a) agree to this EULA, (b) authorise recurring subscription charges until you cancel, and (c) acknowledge that outputs are impersonal search results (search analytics) and not advice.  If you do not agree, you must **not** use the platform.

1**. Scope and who these terms apply to.** This EULA governs your use of Nirvana websites, mobile or desktop applications, and subscriber-only features provided directly by Nirvana to individual Members (D2C). If you first encountered Nirvana through a financial institution or third-party publisher, those parties are **not** Nirvana and have separate responsibilities. Where you access Nirvana through a financial institution, you must still accept this EULA; if there is any conflict between this EULA and the Website Terms, this EULA prevails for Members.

2**. NO SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP; NO ASSUMPTION OF DUTY.** **Use of the Platform does not create any doctor–patient, therapist–patient, attorney–client, fiduciary, or other “special relationship.” Nirvana does not undertake, assume, or accept any duty to rescue, protect, monitor, moderate, warn, follow up, continue a conversation, contact emergency services or third parties, or otherwise act for your benefit beyond providing the software Platform.**

3**. AI content notice.** You understand that outputs may be wrong, incomplete, offensive, or inappropriate for your situation, and you agree you will not rely on any output as a substitute for professional advice in any domain. **Do not use for emergencies.**

**Important notices and consents**

4\. Please read carefully. This summary highlights critical terms of the Nirvana Member EULA and Privacy Notice. It does not replace them.

5\. Price and billing interval are disclosed at checkout and in your account. Subscriptions auto-renew until cancelled. You can cancel online at any time through Account → Manage subscription. Taxes and any metered AI and compute charges are additional where applicable and shown before you pay. Trials convert to paid on the stated date unless you cancel first. You will receive a post-purchase receipt with renewal and cancellation information. This summary does not replace the binding terms of the EULA.

6**. Search Mode \- general conversation.** In **Search Mode**, you may talk with Satya about **any topic** you choose, including finance and non-financial subjects. **Satya may engage on sensitive or controversial topics, but all such content remains impersonal, automated, and information-only.** You agree to obtain qualified professional help where appropriate (e.g., legal, medical, tax, safety), and **you will not rely** on outputs as professional advice. All outputs are **general and impersonal** and are provided for information only; they are **not** professional, legal, tax, medical, or investment advice. In Search Mode, you may hold a paid subscription that covers access, capacity and features other than Search-Plus Features. Payment does not convert Search Mode into advice or enable Search-Plus Features.  Where available, the Platform may display impersonal, catalogue-level surfacing of financial products and Firefly Apps for general information only. Results are generated from a pre-published universe on a general and regular schedule; they do not use your portfolio, holdings, or non-public data. Surfacing, any numeric value (including Compass Score), and ordering are impersonal search relevance results and/or editorial analytics and are **not** personalised recommendations. Any Impersonal Discovery shown in Search Mode is based on a pre-published Universe and Schema on a general and regular schedule and is **not** adapted to your holdings, circumstances, or identity.

7**. Search+ (FI-linked) – search analytics and discovery.** **Search Plus Mode (Search+)** is available **only** if your account is linked to a licensed Financial Institution via that institution’s FI App in your country. When enabled, the platform may display additional **algorithmic search analytics and discovery** on an impersonal basis. These search search search analytics are **not** personalised recommendations; your FI remains responsible for any advice. If **Search+ is not available in your country**, it is because no FI has yet published an FI App for that jurisdiction. You are encouraged to **contact your local FI** if you wish to request Search+ availability. If FI linkage ends, your account **automatically reverts to Search Mode**.

8**. General-purpose use; non-financial domains.** You acknowledge that Satya may generate or display content on any topic that you choose to discuss, including health, mental health, legal, tax, safety, engineering, education, employment, relationships, and other non-financial subjects. All such content is impersonal, automated, and provided for general information only. It is not a substitute for, and must not be relied upon as, professional advice in any domain. You agree not to treat any output as clinical, therapeutic, legal, tax, safety, engineering, or other professional advice, and you will obtain advice from appropriately qualified professionals before acting. You further agree **not to present, forward, or republish** any output **as professional advice** to any third party.

9**. You agree that no duty arises to correct, retract, or harmonise any past output, even if later outputs conflict or additional information becomes available.**

10**. No medical, mental-health, legal, tax, safety, or other professional advice.** Nirvana is not a health-care provider, mental-health provider, legal practitioner, law firm, tax adviser, engineer, emergency-response service, or safety authority. Satya’s outputs do not diagnose, treat, mitigate, or cure any disease or condition; **do not provide therapy**; do not constitute legal opinions or legal services; do not provide tax advice; and do not provide instructions for hazardous activities. You must consult a licensed professional before you rely on any output relating to these domains. If you choose to act without obtaining professional advice, you do so solely at your own risk.

11**. Emergencies and crisis situations.** The Platform is not suitable for emergencies. If you believe you may harm yourself or others, or face a medical, safety, or security emergency, call local emergency services immediately. Nirvana does not monitor conversations in real time, has no obligation to respond, and undertakes no duty to contact emergency services, third parties, or your adviser.

12\. You represent that you do not rely on Nirvana for the truth, accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness of any output across any domain, financial or otherwise, and you irrevocably waive any claim arising from such reliance. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you release Nirvana from any and all claims connected with your health, legal, tax, safety, employment, educational, or personal decisions that you take based on Platform outputs.

13**. No duty to monitor or to warn.** Nirvana does not undertake to monitor chats, detect risks, or provide warnings or interventions. You agree that Nirvana owes you no duty to monitor, verify, correct, update, escalate, or warn about any output or omitted output, and no duty to contact you, your adviser, authorities, or any third party.

14**. Automated safety messages**. The Platform may display automated crisis-resource messages based solely on typed words. These messages are generated without human review and do not create any duty to monitor, assess risk, warn, follow up, or contact you or any third party.

15**. Self-harm and violent-harm content.** The Platform must not be used to seek, provide, or disseminate methods, steps, or “how-to” instructions for self-harm, suicide, or harm to others. If any output appears to contain such instructions, you must disregard it, refrain from acting on it, and report it via the in-app mechanism. Nirvana does not authorise such content and shall have no liability for any action taken in contravention of this clause.

16**. No duty to speak or to provide complete information.** You acknowledge that the Platform has no obligation to provide exhaustive, comprehensive, or balanced information on any topic, to present alternatives, to identify or explain all risks, or to correct, supplement, or continue any prior communication. No liability shall arise from any omission, silence, partial response, or decision not to engage on a topic.

17**. Variability of outputs.** Outputs may vary between sessions and over time, including giving different, inconsistent, or contradictory responses to similar prompts. Such variability is expected and does not create any duty to harmonise, reconcile, or explain differences, and shall not give rise to any claim.

18**. Prohibited uses; user representations.** You shall not use the Platform to seek or provide instructions that are unlawful or reasonably likely to cause harm (including instructions for self-harm, violence, explosives, or unsafe medical dosing). You represent that you will not rely on Satya for a decision that could create a risk of death, personal injury, property damage, or environmental harm. If you nevertheless choose to do so, you assume all related risks and agree that Nirvana shall have no liability.

19**. Sensitive-data acknowledgement.** You may disclose sensitive personal data (for example, health, mental-health, biometric, sexual-life, or religious information) in chats. You are not required to disclose such data. If you choose to do so, you give explicit consent for Nirvana to process that data to generate impersonal search analytics and to provide the Services as described in the Privacy Notice. You may withdraw consent at any time using the in-app controls, after which further processing for those purposes will cease, subject to legally permitted retention.

20**. Age and vulnerable-user notice.** If you are a minor under applicable law, you may use **Search Mode** only with **verifiable parental or legal-guardian consent** obtained through Nirvana’s process **or** via your FI. **Search Plus Mode** is available to minors only through an FI and subject to that FI’s verification of parental consent. The Platform is not designed for individuals who require clinical, therapeutic, or crisis support.

**Full terms \- please read carefully**

**Nirvana does not provide advice \- Mandatory consultation:**  Before taking any **investment** decision based on search outputs generated by Nirvana, you must obtain personalised advice from a licensed financial professional in your jurisdiction (for **Linked Members**, your FI). Any decision made without such advice is undertaken entirely at your own risk and expense.

Nirvana’s results are a function of your **inputs**, not your identity.

Nirvana is an automated **search engine/information tool**.  It is not a registered or licensed investment adviser, broker-dealer, commodity trading adviser, futures commission merchant, bank, trust company, custodian, insurance producer, credit provider, fiduciary, underwriter, clearing or settlement agent, or provider of legal, tax, or accounting advice, and it does not execute trades, hold client assets, arrange financing, or intermediate securities transactions. The projections, scores, and product matches you see in the app are generated by algorithms using historical data and third-party sources; they are meant solely to help you **start a conversation** with your own licensed financial adviser or financial institution, who must confirm whether any product is suitable for you before you act. Because data feeds may contain errors, markets change, and past patterns do **not** guarantee future results, the figures Nirvana produces may be incomplete, outdated, or simply wrong, and you must treat them as illustrative estimates, not promises. You alone decide what to do with this information and bear all responsibility for any investment or tax choices you make. By using Nirvana, you agree that Nirvana is not liable for losses or damages arising from decisions you take on the basis of its outputs or its silence, and you acknowledge that nothing in the service constitutes personalised advice, a recommendation, or an offer to buy or sell any financial product, service, or transaction. Please read the full EULA for the legally binding details before proceeding.

1. **Definitions**

   1. **Nirvana:** Nirvana X Limited, an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of Bermuda, with its registered office at c/o Conyers Corporate Services (Bermuda) Limited, Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda, acting as the provider of the technology platform described in this EULA (also referred to as “we” or “us”).  
   2. **Member (also “you”)**: the end user who has accepted this EULA and maintains an active Nirvana account. A Member may be (i) an **Unlinked Member** (Search Mode only) or (ii) a **Linked Member** (Search Plus Mode via a Designated FI).  
   3. **Financial Institution or Adviser (FI):** Your independent, duly Licensed investment adviser or other regulated financial institution of record who has offered you access to the Nirvana platform through a co-branded FI App. This FI is solely responsible for providing you with personalized investment advice outside of the Nirvana platform.​  
   4. **FI App:** The co-branded software application provided by Nirvana on behalf of your FI, through which you access Nirvana’s search analytics and services as a Member.  
   5. **Platform:** Nirvana’s technology and data-processing platform, including the Nirvana network, the FI App, and Nirvana’s AI tools (such as Satya and Proximity) that generate analytical outputs. **Search-Plus Features** may be displayed only in **Search Plus Mode** and are disabled in **Search Mode**.  
   6. **Subscription** means a paid, auto-renewing right to access Member-only features for the disclosed billing interval.  
   7. **Merchant of record; seller of record.** Purchases of subscriptions or paid features are processed either by **Nirvana** as merchant of record, or by an **appointed merchant of record identified at checkout** (the “MoR”). The MoR is the **seller of record** for billing, invoicing, tax collection and refunds. Any sale contract with the MoR is **separate** and its terms will be provided at checkout.   
   8. **Cancellation** means an instruction you submit through Account → Manage subscription that stops future renewals. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current paid period unless we state otherwise.  
   9. **Satya:** Nirvana’s conversational artificial intelligence assistant, which interacts with Members to gather information and provide automated responses. In **Search Mode**, Satya provides general, impersonal information only and does not compute or display any **Search-Plus Features**.  
   10. **Proximity:** Nirvana’s proprietary search engine that surfaces financial products, services, or third-party apps.  
   11. **Universe:** the **versioned** set of eligible Products, Services, and Firefly Apps that may be surfaced at a given time.  
   12. **Compass Score:** a **0–10,000** rules-based **search-relevance index** assigned by Proximity **after** an item has passed the Nirvana Standard; it is impersonal and **not** a suitability, appropriateness, or “fit” measure for your investments, and it is **not** advice or a prediction.  
   13. **Schema:** the **versioned** set of rule families, fields, variables, thresholds, and operators used to instantiate the Nirvana Standard and evaluate and rank eligible items.  
   14. **Canonical Query Principle:** within the same Catalogue Snapshot**, **Universe**, **Schema, and** **Algorithm Version**, **identical Member-selected parameters yield identical outputs and display order, independent of Member identity or history.  
   15. **Impersonal Discovery:** catalogue-level surfacing of eligible items and any displayed indices (including Compass Score) for **information only**; **not** a recommendation or suitability assessment.  
   16. **Promotion Code (“Trust Code”):** a discount mechanism that reduces the subscription price as disclosed at checkout; codes are **not** stackable unless expressly stated and do **not** apply to à-la-carte features (e.g., Sur) unless expressly stated.  
   17. **Operational Pass-Through Charges** means any per-Member, usage-based fee for AI processing, cloud-compute or storage, carbon-offset credits, or analogous infrastructure inputs required to operate the Nirvana Platform.  
   18. **Analemma Fee**.  Certain Firefly Apps may enrol in Nirvana’s Analemma composite-solution programme (see **Schedule B** for an illustrative explanation).  If Nirvana automatically assembles a composite solution using such Apps, a metered “Analemma Fee” calculated automatically under the Platform Rules will appear as a separate line-item on your invoice. The Analemma Fee **replaces** any separate Invocation Fee for the Apps participating in the composite run, is subject to the standard 70 / 30 revenue share (30 % retained by Nirvana as its platform fee and 70 % distributed to the contributing Firefly Publishers).  It is a part of the billing statement that is final and non-auditable under the “Billing statements final; no audit right” clause. Analemma Fees are shown only when two or more Apps are combined.** **The Analemma Fee is subject to the Dynamic Cap mechanism described in the Platform Rules.  
   19. **Invocation Fee** means the Member-payable amount quoted for a single App invocation, exclusive of Operational Pass-Through Charges.  
   20. **Sur:** **Sur** is Nirvana’s assembler. It translates Member-selected search parameters into a deterministic ordering of vetted products, services, third-party apps, and pre-published reference slates. Drawing exclusively from offerings that have cleared the Nirvana Standard and from a pre-published catalogue maintained on a general and regular schedule, Sur applies a uniform, rules-based process to filter and order eligible entries by an impersonal relevance index tied to those parameters. The Compass Score is a search-relevance index; it does not measure suitability, appropriateness, or “fit” to any person’s circumstances or existing investments, and it is not investment advice, a personal recommendation, or a prediction of future performance. It exists solely to determine the display order of eligible results. Sur may display an illustrative, non-executable reference slate drawn from the pre-published catalogue for illustration only, with full transparency and auditability at every stage. Outputs are impersonal, reproducible, and timestamped; identical inputs on the same data snapshot produce identical outputs. Sur does not consider any person’s financial circumstances or holdings and does not provide investment advice, a recommendation (personal or impersonal), portfolio management, or arrange or execute transactions.  
   21. **Sur Fee**: **Sur fee** is charged when a Member invokes Sur. Each Invocation is billed at the price quoted in-product at the time of invocation, exclusive of Operational Pass-Through Charges. Invocation Fees compensate for search computation and record-keeping and are not contingent on Score changes or any outcome.  
   22. **Nirvana Standard:**  **Nirvana Standard** means Nirvana’s internal, rules-based eligibility gate applied uniformly to all **Products** and **Services**. It comprises quality, integrity, and policy criteria designated by Nirvana. Only items that pass the Nirvana Standard are eligible to appear in results; items that do not pass are excluded. For the relevant **Catalogue Snapshot** and **Schema**, an item passes the Nirvana Standard only if (a) it is included in the **Universe**, and (b) it satisfies all applicable quantitative, qualitative, integrity, and policy criteria designated by Nirvana. Items that do not pass are ineligible to appear in search results. Passing or failing the Standard is **identity-neutral**, is not a personal recommendation or suitability assessment, and does not consider any individual’s financial circumstances. After the Standard is applied, **Proximity** assigns a search-relevance score (the **Compass Score**) to eligible items and determines **their** display order for relevance to the selected search parameters.  
   23. **Firefly Apps (Third-Party Services):** Software applications or services offered by independent third-party providers (publishers) through Nirvana’s “Firefly” Ecosystem. Firefly Apps can be accessed via the Platform to extend Nirvana’s functionality (for example, additional financial tools or content provided by third parties). These are not created by Nirvana, though they integrate with the Nirvana Platform.  
   24. **Platform Rules** means the technical, security, design, content and commercial policies for the Nirvana Network published by Nirvana from time to time.  
   25. **Promotional Communication** – any advertisement, marketing e-mail, social-media post, announcement, brochure, or other public-facing material that promotes, refers to, or otherwise distributes information about the Services.  
   26. **Business Day** means a day other than a Saturday or Sunday on which banks in Hamilton, Bermuda are open for business.  
   27. **Search Mode** means the information-only configuration of the Platform in which (a) no **Search-Plus Features** are available; (b) Satya may discuss financial topics only in **general** terms; (c) the Platform does **not** receive, store, or process **Customer Information**.  
   28. **Search Plus Mode** means the configuration available only to a **Linked Member** whose account is linked to a **licensed Financial Institution** in the Member’s jurisdiction, under which the Platform may display **Search-Plus Features**.   
   29. **Search Plus Mode** is branded “**Search+**” in user interfaces.  
   30. **Linked Member** means a Member whose account is linked in the Platform to a licensed Financial Institution (the **Designated FI**).  
   31. **Unlinked Member** means a Member who has not linked a Designated FI; Unlinked Members may access **Search Mode** only.  
   32. **Unpartnered Jurisdiction** means any country or territory in which no licensed Financial Institution has published an FI App on the Nirvana Platform.  
   33. **Search Output** means content generated by Satya in **Search Mode** that is (i) general, impersonal information; (ii) not tailored to the Member; (iii) not a recommendation, solicitation, or financial promotion; and (iv) prohibited from endorsing specific financial products, services, issuers, or instruments.  
   34. **Catalogue Snapshot** means the timestamped, published set of eligible products and Firefly Apps in effect when a query is processed.  
   35. **Algorithm Version** means the published identifier of the Proximity/Compass configuration in effect when a query is processed.

   

**Right to curate and exclude.** *We may, at any time and in our sole discretion, define, expand, limit, suspend, withdraw, or otherwise modify the Universe, Schema, Catalogue Snapshots, and any indices or display ordering, including by rejecting, removing, de-listing, downgrading, or excluding any Product, Service, or Firefly App for any reason or no reason, with or without notice. We do not undertake to include any particular item or provider, and we have **no obligation to explain decisions**. Outputs may change accordingly. Nothing in this Agreement limits rights that cannot be excluded by law.*

**Methodology changes** *We may modify, replace, or discontinue any part of the Nirvana Standard, Proximity, the Compass Score, Sur, and related methodologies (including variables, thresholds, and weightings) at any time, without notice. We are not required to disclose detailed methodologies.*

2. **Neutral Platform – No Investment Advice or Regulated Services**

**Modes of operation; automatic gating.** The Platform operates in two modes: **Search Mode** (information-only; no **Search-Plus Features**) and **Search Plus Mode** (**Search+**; **Search-Plus Features** available). 

The Platform automatically limits functionality by reference to (i) whether you are a **Linked Member** and (ii) whether your country is an **Unpartnered Jurisdiction**. If either condition is not met, only **Search Mode** is available and all **Search-Plus Features** are disabled.

**No personalised advice in either mode.** All Platform outputs are impersonal and for general information only. **Search Plus Mode** displays algorithmic search analytics and discovery on an impersonal basis for **Linked Members** under their FI’s profile. Where Impersonal Discovery is offered, any surfacing is catalogue-level, impersonal and not advice.  For the avoidance of doubt, Nirvana’s outputs are **impersonal publications of general and regular circulation** and are not personal recommendations or investment advice to any person.

Nirvana is not providing you with investment advice, and it does not engage in any activity that would make it a regulated financial adviser or broker-dealer under U.S. or Bermuda law. The foregoing capacity limitations apply **world-wide**. Nirvana is **not** licensed or authorised by: (i) any Canadian provincial securities commission; (ii) the UK Financial Conduct Authority; (iii) any EU competent authority under MiFID II; (iv) the Japan Financial Services Agency; (v) the China Securities Regulatory Commission, PBOC or CBIRC; (vi) the Securities and Exchange Board of India; or (vii) the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. Members resident in those jurisdictions access the Platform solely as a cross-border software service and must rely on their locally licensed adviser for any personalised recommendation.In particular, Nirvana’s services do not include any of the following regulated activities​:

1. **No Investment Advice or Recommendations:** Nirvana does not furnish personal investment advice, recommendations, or endorsements about any particular securities, investments, or strategies to you. Any analytical output or information you receive from the Platform is an **impersonal** search result and for informational purposes only – it is not tailored advice for your individual situation​.  
   2. **Limited-Data Scope; No Ingestion of Bank Customer Information**: Nirvana acts solely on the basis of: (i) statements that the Member voluntarily types into Satya or the FI App; and (ii) publicly-available or properly-licensed market data.** ** Nirvana does not receive, store, or process any non-public personal information held by the Member’s Financial Institution, including account balances, transaction history, KYC files, or other records (“Customer Information”). All such Customer Information remains exclusively under the FI’s custody and governance. In **Search Mode**, the Platform does **not** receive, store, or process **Customer Information** and will not request it.  
1) **No FI transmission.** The FI shall not transmit Customer Information to Nirvana and shall implement reasonable measures to prevent any accidental transmission.  
2) **Deletion upon discovery.** If any Customer Information is inadvertently submitted, Nirvana will delete it promptly upon discovery and will not use it for any purpose.  
3) Accordingly, because Nirvana **receives no Customer Information** and exercises no investment discretion, an FI’s use of the Platform shall not be treated as an outsourcing arrangement under OSFI Guideline E-21, FCA PS21/3, EU DORA, or analogous rules in any other jurisdiction.  
4) **Member inputs distinguished.** Conversational inputs supplied by the Member inside Nirvana are **not** Customer Information and may be processed to generate impersonal search analytics.  
5) **Member-typed inputs are not Customer Information** and may be processed to generate **impersonal** search analytics; Nirvana does **not** request or ingest non-public records held by your FI.  
6) **No personalised advice.** Nothing in the Platform, including the Compass Score, Proximity matches, or Nirvana Standard filters, constitutes personalised advice; Members must consult their FI before acting on any output.  
   3. **Assumption of Investment Risk; Waiver of Reliance**  
      (a) **Market risk acknowledged.** The Member understands that all investments can lose value and that past performance, simulated results, or search display orderings are **not** indications of suitability or indicative or guarantees of future performance.  
      (b) **Sole responsibility.** The Member **accepts sole responsibility** for all investment decisions, including any decision to rely, in whole or in part, on Platform outputs.  
      (c) **No reliance on Nirvana.** The Member represents that it **does not rely** on Nirvana (or its officers, directors, employees, agents, or contractors) for the truth, accuracy, or completeness of any information, display order, or projection supplied through the Platform and **irrevocably waives** any claim arising out of such reliance.  
      (d) **Release.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Member **releases and forever discharges** Nirvana from any and all claims— whether sounding in contract, tort, statute, equity, or otherwise— for losses, costs, or damages sustained or alleged to be sustained in connection with the Member’s investment activities.  
      (e) In entering this waiver you acknowledge that Nirvana owes you **no duty of care** and that any cause of action premised on negligent misrepresentation or similar theory is expressly disclaimed.  
   4. **No Brokerage or Execution of Transactions:** Nirvana does **not** arrange, execute, or facilitate the execution of purchase or sale orders for securities or other financial instruments on your behalf​. If you decide to act upon any search analytics or information from the Platform, you (or your FI) must execute any resulting transactions through appropriate Licensed broker-dealers, custodians, or other regulated entities outside of Nirvana​. Nirvana does **not** transmit trade orders or match counterparties.  
   5. **No Promotion or Solicitation:** Nirvana does not solicit, offer, or promote specific investments to the public. Any products or services you learn about via the Platform are presented based on your inputs and algorithmic criteria – not because Nirvana is recommending them to you.  
   6. **Search-Mode Promotional Legend (global).**  
      “**For information purposes only.** You are interacting with an **AI system**. Satya **Search** mode provides general conversation and education. It does **not** provide financial, legal, tax, medical, or other professional advice. **Search-Plus Features are unavailable unless and until you link a licensed Financial Institution.**”  
   7. **No Portfolio Management or Discretionary Control:** Nirvana does not manage your portfolio or investments. It has no discretionary authority over any of your assets and cannot make investment decisions for you. The Platform’s role is limited to providing tools and analysis; **all investment decisions remain with you and your adviser.** Nirvana **never exercises discretion** over your account or assets​.  
   8. **No Custody of Funds or Assets:** Nirvana does not hold, safeguard, or custody any of your money, funds, or securities. The Platform is a software service only – **Nirvana never takes possession of your assets** or maintains accounts holding your financial instruments​.  
   9. **No Guaranteed Outcomes or Regulated Business:** Nirvana does not engage in any other activity that would constitute “investment business” requiring licensing, such as guaranteeing investment outcomes or offering any form of insured or capital-protected product. Nirvana’s role is limited strictly to providing software and data-analytics support; it is not an investment adviser or broker to any person.

By operating in this limited capacity, **Nirvana is not registered as an investment adviser under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and it is not a broker-dealer under U.S. securities laws**​. Nirvana does not render any services that would require registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Likewise, under Bermuda law, Nirvana’s activities are conducted within a statutory exemption (the “safe harbour for introductions to Licensed persons” under section 3(2)(b)(iii) of the Bermuda Investment Business Act 2003\) (and, for Bermuda-resident Members, subject to the Designated FI linkage requirement set out above) such that Nirvana is not engaged in licensable investment business​. In other words, Nirvana’s services are limited to software and data processing support and do not involve any regulated investment advisory or brokerage services that would require a Licence in the United States or Bermuda.

3. **Territorial compliance and jurisdiction-specific disclaimers**

   1. **Territorial feature gating.** In any **Unpartnered Jurisdiction**, the Platform is available solely in **Search Mode**. **Search-Plus Features** are disabled until a local licensed Financial Institution has published an **FI App** and the Member becomes a **Linked Member**. If Search+ is not available in your country, it is because **no FI has yet published an FI App** for that jurisdiction. If you wish to access Search+, you are encouraged to **contact your FI** to request availability.  
   2. **Cross-border regulatory status**. The capacity limitations stated under *Neutral Platform – No Investment Advice or Regulated Services* apply in every jurisdiction in which the Platform is made available. **Schedule A** (Jurisdiction-Specific Regulatory Disclaimers) forms part of this EULA.  
   3. **Preservation of mandatory local rights**: Nothing in this EULA limits any non-waivable statutory right or remedy that a Member enjoys under the consumer-protection, privacy, or investment-services laws of the country or territory in which that Member is habitually resident. If a provision of this EULA is held unenforceable under such mandatory law, it shall be construed to give it the maximum permissible effect and the balance of the Agreement shall remain in full force.  
   4. **Schedules**: Territory-specific statements appear in Schedule A. Schedule A forms part of this EULA.

   

4. **Role of Your FI (**This section applies only to Linked Members using Search+ via a licensed FI.)

For Nirvana’s capacity limitations and regulatory status, see Section 3 **Neutral Platform – No Investment Advice or Regulated Services**.

1. **Your FI remains your investment adviser and fiduciary.** By using the Platform, you acknowledge that you are a client of a third-party FI, and that your FI (not Nirvana) is solely responsible for providing you with any personalized investment advice or recommendations​. Nirvana’s search analytics are supplied as an impartial technology output. They **do not constitute advice** and shall not be communicated to you as advice unless and until your FI has independently reviewed and chosen to incorporate them into its own professional assessment.  
   2. **Non-delegation of regulated functions*.**** *The FI does not delegate, and Nirvana does not assume, any regulated advisory, portfolio-management, suitability-assessment, know-your-client, or fiduciary function. Nirvana acts solely as a software vendor and data-processing service provider. The generation of search analytics by Nirvana therefore does not constitute “outsourcing” or “material outsourcing” under applicable financial-services regulations, and the FI retains full responsibility for all regulated functions.  
   3. **Consult Your FI:** You agree that you will consult with your FI for any **investment advice, guidance, or to confirm the suitability** of any product or strategy suggested by the Platform. The Platform’s outputs are **impersonal and algorithmic**; only your FI can take into account your entire financial picture, objectives, and risk profile to provide a personal recommendation. **Before you make any investment decision or implement any strategy shown on the Platform, you will obtain professional advice from your FI**. If you have questions or concerns about any search analytics or suggestions from Nirvana’s Platform, you must discuss them with your adviser. **Nirvana’s search analytics are not a substitute for your adviser’s personalized advice.**

**5\. Subscription and billing**

5.1 **Annual billing.** Consumer subscriptions are billed annually in advance. Where monthly pricing is displayed, it is an equivalent monthly rate for comparison only. 

5.2 **Auto-renewal.** Subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each paid period unless you cancel. By subscribing you authorise the Merchant of Record to charge the payment method on file at each renewal until you cancel.

5.3 **Trials and promotions.** If a trial or promotional period is offered, the first charge will occur on the stated conversion date unless you cancel before that date. We will tell you if any material trial limitations apply.

**5.4 Promotions and Trust Codes.**

(a) **Trust Codes.** A “**Trust Code**” is a promotional code issued by Nirvana or an authorised distribution partner that reduces the Member’s subscription fee.

(b) **Discount amount and term.** A valid Trust Code provides a **10%** discount on the then-current **subscription fee** for up to **five (5) years** from the Member’s **first successful paid subscription date** (the “**Discount Window**”). The discount applies only to the subscription fee and **excludes Sur**, Invocation Fees, Operational Pass-Through Charges, taxes, and any other usage-based or one-off charges. **Pauses, cancellations, or resumptions do not extend or reset** the Discount Window; the discount applies only to billed months within that window.

(c) **One code; non-stackable; no cash value.** One Trust Code per Member account. Trust Codes are non-transferable, non-stackable unless expressly stated, have no cash value, and may not be sold or exchanged.

(d) **Display and receipts.** The **net price after any Trust Code discount** is shown before purchase and itemised on receipts; where required, prices are shown in the **local currency**.

(e) **Fraud and ineligibility.** Nirvana may refuse, suspend, or revoke a Trust Code in cases of fraud, self-referral, ineligibility, or misuse.

(f) **Changes.** Nirvana may modify or discontinue the Trust Code programme **prospectively** by notice on the Site; **existing, validly-applied** Trust Codes are honoured for the remainder of their Discount Window except where revoked under clause (e).

(g) **Other promotions; no third-party rights.** Codes **do not apply to Sur or other à-la-carte features** unless expressly stated. **Code attribution and any third-party commercial arrangements** are **not** benefits of this Agreement and confer **no rights** on the Member.5.5 **Changes to price or features.** We may change prices or materially modify included features with at least 30 days’ notice by email or in-app notice. Price changes take effect on the next renewal after notice.

5.6 **Receipts.** After each purchase or renewal, you will receive a receipt that includes how to cancel and the next renewal date.

5.7 **Multiple offerings.** Subscription fees cover access to Member-only features. Metered Operational Pass-Through Charges and any Invocation or Analemma Fees are separate where you choose to invoke those features.

6**. Cancellation and refunds**

6.1 **How to cancel.** You may cancel online at any time through Account → Manage subscription. Cancellation stops future renewals and takes effect at the end of the current paid period unless we state otherwise.

6.2 **Refunds.** Except where required by law or expressly stated, fees are non-refundable and partial months are not credited. If a jurisdiction grants you statutory withdrawal or cooling-off rights, Section 7 applies.

6.3 **Reactivation.** You may reactivate at any time; a new term begins on payment.

7**. Jurisdiction-specific consumer rights**

7.1 **United Kingdom and European Union.** If you are a consumer resident in the UK or EU, you may have a 14-day right to withdraw from a distance contract. By starting to use the digital service during the withdrawal period you request immediate performance and acknowledge that we may charge a proportionate amount or that your right to withdraw may be lost once the service is fully performed.

7.2 **United States.** Where state auto-renewal laws require specific labelling, advance renewal notices, or online cancellation, we will comply and those requirements are incorporated here.

3. **Canada and other territories.** Mandatory consumer protections in your place of habitual residence prevail to the extent they cannot lawfully be waived.

8. **Algorithmic Search analytics and Impersonal Outputs – what the numbers mean**

Nirvana’s Platform provides a range of algorithmic, analytic tools to help you and your adviser evaluate financial options. These include, for example, the Nirvana Standard filter, the Proximity search results, and ordering of displayed products by the Compass Score search index. All such search analytics are generated automatically by algorithms applying formulas and criteria uniformly to all users​. They are impersonal search engine outputs, not personalized recommendations. The search analytics are based solely on the search parameter you provide and on historical data and objective criteria – they do not account for all aspects of your personal situation, and no human adviser from Nirvana has customized them for you.

1. **Examples of Platform Search analytics:** For clarity, some key search analytics provided may include:

* **Nirvana Standard:** **The Nirvana Standard: Nirvana Standard** is Nirvana’s internal, rules-based eligibility gate. It applies uniform, absolute quality and integrity criteria to all Products and Services. Only offerings that pass the Nirvana Standard are eligible to appear in results; offerings that fail are excluded. The Standard is not a personal recommendation or suitability assessment and does not consider an individual’s financial circumstances. After the Standard is applied, Proximity assigns a search relevance index (Compass Score) to eligible items and them sorts them for relevance to the Member’s selected search parameters.  (If an offering does not satisfy the Nirvana Standard criteria, it will typically be filtered out and not shown to you.)

* **Proximity: Proximity** is the analytical brain of Nirvana, our proprietary, rules-based **search engine**. It encodes Member-selected search parameters into a high-dimensional parameter vector, searches the universe of eligible products and Firefly Apps, applies the proprietary Nirvana Standard as a rules gate, computes a Compass Score for each candidate, and surfaces the highest-scoring (nearest) matches for the selected parameters. Where available for the given parameter set, Proximity may call Sur, Nirvana’s portfolio-constructor technology, to generate a hypothetical, rules-based reference composition consistent with those parameters.

  Outputs are impersonal and reproducible (identical inputs produce identical outputs) and do not assess whether a user’s parameters are appropriate. In the U.S. consumer product, Proximity serves catalogue entries from a pre-published catalogue on a general and regular schedule and is not adapted to any individual’s portfolio or needs. These materials do not constitute investment advice, a personal recommendation, portfolio management, or an invitation to transact.

* **The Compass Score**: **The Compass Score** is a** 0–10,000**, rules-based **relevance index **assigned by **Proximity** after a **Product** or **Service** has passed the **Nirvana Standard**. It quantifies how closely an eligible item matches the **Member-selected search parameters **for the current query.  The scores are **not personalised** and do not represent suitability or “fit”. Two people with completely different financial pictures entering **the same search parameters at the same time** will see **the same products in the same order** and **the same relevance scores**.

  **Search-engine analogy:** Like a web search engine, Proximity sorts matches using internal relevance signals. Web search engines maintain internal numeric relevance scores (for example, Google’s PageRank era scores and successors) but do not display them. **Nirvana makes the relevance explicit by showing the Compass Score for each eligible result.**  

  **No personal or behavioural inputs.** Compass Scores and search result ordering use only the Member-selected **search parameters** together with system-wide criteria and datasets. They do **not** use a Member’s financial situation, holdings, risk profile, history, cookies, or behavioural signals.

  **Determinism and identity-neutrality.** Within the same **Catalogue Snapshot**, **Universe**, **Schema**, and **Algorithm Version**, **identical inputs produce identical outputs and display order**. Display order is **never** influenced by provider payments or undisclosed commercial factors. Outputs may change when any of those versioned elements change, or when the Member’s selected parameters change.

  **Explicit non-suitability statement:** The Compass Score does **not** measure suitability, appropriateness, or “fit” to any person’s circumstances or existing investments, and it is **not** investment advice, a personal recommendation, or a prediction of future performance. It exists solely to order the eligible set for display.

  Cataloguing and any Compass Score displayed in Impersonal Discovery are impersonal editorial search analytics based on pre-published criteria; Search+ may enable additional search analytics when you are linked to an FI.

For Nirvana’s advisory-capacity limitations and regulatory status, see Section 3 **Neutral Platform – No Investment Advice or Regulated Services**.

8. **AI Assistant (Satya) – Limitations and Cautions**

As part of the Platform, you may interact with **Satya**, Nirvana’s AI-driven assistant. Satya is designed to engage in natural language dialogue with you to help gather information about your goals and preferences and to provide explanatory answers or guidance within the scope of the Platform’s functionality. 

**Satya is an automated tool and has inherent limitations**. By using Satya, you acknowledge and accept the following:

1. **Potential for Errors (“Hallucinations”):** Satya generates responses using artificial intelligence algorithms, which may sometimes produce incorrect, irrelevant, or nonsensical information. The AI might present information in a confident manner that is actually false or incomplete – a phenomenon sometimes referred to as a “hallucination” in AI outputs. **Nirvana does not guarantee the accuracy, truthfulness, or completeness of any response given by Satya.** You should **not rely solely on Satya’s statements** for making decisions. If Satya provides any factual data, explanations, or analysis that could influence your decisions, **you must verify that information independently or consult your FI for confirmation.**  
   2. **AI transparency.** You are interacting with an **AI system**, not a human. Use does not create a professional, fiduciary, therapeutic, or advisory relationship.  
   3. **Incomplete Understanding of Your Inputs:** Satya and the Platform rely on the information you provide. **If the information or goals you communicate are incorrect, ambiguous, or incomplete, the outputs and advice derived from them will likely be flawed.** The AI may misunderstand your questions or misinterpret your objectives. For example, if you use informal language or omit details, Satya might not capture your intent perfectly. **It is your responsibility to provide clear, accurate, and thorough information about your financial situation, goals, and preferences.** Nirvana is not responsible for any outcome that is based on the AI’s misunderstanding of your input or context.  
   4. **No Professional Judgment:** Satya’s interactions with you are automated and do not involve review or correction by a human adviser from Nirvana. The AI does **not** have the ability to exercise human judgment, recognize nuanced personal circumstances, or give weighted advice. **Any suggestions or answers from Satya are to be taken as preliminary and informational, not definitive guidance.** Always discuss important decisions or any action items with your human FI before proceeding.  
   5. **Use consistent with the Platform**. You may use Satya to discuss a wide range of topics. All outputs are impersonal and not professional advice. You will not rely on Satya for decisions that could create a risk of death, personal injury, property damage, legal exposure, or financial loss, and you will seek qualified professional advice where appropriate. In Search Mode you may discuss any topic; outputs remain impersonal and not professional advice. Where Impersonal Discovery is available, Satya may display impersonal, catalogue-level search results and relevance scores. Satya does not endorse any product and does not personalise the search display order.

In summary, **Satya is a convenience tool** to enhance your experience, but it has significant limitations common to AI technology. Nirvana disclaims any liability for **errors or misunderstandings arising from Satya’s outputs**, and **you use the assistant at your own risk.** The authoritative guidance on your financial plan must come from your FI. Always double-check important information from Satya and do not act on Satya’s communications in isolation. Nirvana may review and improve Satya’s performance over time, but no AI is perfect. **You acknowledge that automated tools like Satya can misunderstand queries or produce misleading content, and you agree to exercise due caution and consult human expertise when using such tools.**

10**. Proprietary algorithms; no reverse engineering**. 

You acknowledge that the Nirvana Standard, Proximity engine, Compass Score, and all other matching, search display order, fee-calculation, or other algorithms (collectively, the “Nirvana Algorithms”) are proprietary trade secrets of Nirvana.  The inner logic, weightings, training data, and source code of the Nirvana Algorithms are strictly confidential and may change without notice.  You obtain no right to access, inspect, decompile, or reverse-engineer the Nirvana Algorithms, nor to require Nirvana to disclose them (in whole or in part) for any purpose.  You accept that the outputs of the Nirvana Algorithms are provided “as-is”, may be inaccurate or incomplete. Outputs may vary session-to-session and over time.  All outputs are provided without any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy or non-infringement.

11. **Subscription & Fees.** All amounts charged to Members under this Agreement constitute software-processing and hosting fees only; no portion is consideration for investment advice, portfolio management, or any other regulated service.

12. **Sur Invocations & Fees (non-contingent).**  When the Member invokes Sur an invocation fee is charged. Each **Sur Invocation** is billed at the quoted **Invocation Fee**, exclusive of Operational Pass-Through Charges. **Invocation Fees compensate for computation and record-keeping and are not contingent** on any Compass Score change or any investment outcome.   
      
      
13. **Billing statements final; no audit right**. 

Nirvana will provide electronic statements itemising Invocation Fees and Operational Pass-Through Charges. Each statement is conclusive and binding unless you notify Nirvana of a manifest arithmetic error within thirty (30) days; you waive any right to audit or inspect underlying metering or algorithmic calculations.

14. **Third-Party Apps and Services (Firefly Ecosystem)**

The Nirvana Platform may provide you with access to **third-party products, services, or applications** that are not developed or controlled by Nirvana. For example, your FI’s App may enable access to **Firefly Apps** – independent financial tools or content published by third-party providers through Nirvana’s Firefly Ecosystem. It may also present information about financial products (such as investment funds, insurance, loans, etc.) offered by third-party companies. This section clarifies the responsibility and risk regarding any such third-party offerings:

1. **Third-Party Provider Responsibility:** **Any Firefly App or third-party service you access through the Platform is the sole responsibility of its independent publisher or provider.** While Nirvana’s Platform facilitates your access to these services (by hosting the Ecosystem and integrating the apps for use within Nirvana), **Nirvana does not own, control, or guarantee third-party content or services.** The third-party provider is **entirely accountable for the features, functionality, accuracy, legality, performance, and support of its own app or service**​. For example, if there is a third-party portfolio analysis tool or a budgeting app accessible in the FI App, the creators of that tool are responsible for its content and ensuring it works correctly – not Nirvana.  
   2. **No Endorsement or Advice:** **Nirvana does not endorse or recommend any third-party product or service** that may appear on the Platform. The inclusion of a third-party app in the Firefly Ecosystem or the appearance of a financial product in your Proximity results **does not constitute a promotion or solicitation by Nirvana**. The Platform may list options based on your inputs, but **Nirvana makes no representation that any third-party offering is appropriate, reliable, or suitable for you**. You should perform your own due diligence (in consultation with your FI) before using any third-party app or investing in any third-party product discovered through Nirvana.  
   3. **No Nirvana Warranty or Liability for Third-Party Services:** **Nirvana provides third-party content “as is” and disclaims all warranties and liability related to third-party services.** Nirvana **shall not be liable for any errors, omissions, or malfunctions in third-party apps**, nor for any losses or damages arising from your use of or reliance on any content or functionality provided by third parties. **Any transaction, data exchange, or interaction between you and a third-party provider is solely between you and that third party.** Nirvana is not responsible for any third-party’s compliance with laws or regulations, or for any consequences if a third-party service fails to meet your expectations or causes any harm. If you encounter any issues or disputes with a third-party app or service (for example, inaccurate information in a third-party tool, or a third-party’s failure to protect your data), **you must resolve those with the third-party provider**. Nirvana cannot be held responsible for the conduct, performance, or outcomes of third-party offerings.  
   4. **Third-Party Data Disclaimer.** The Platform may include data supplied by third-party providers. Nirvana makes no warranty as to the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of such data and shall have no liability for errors originating with third-party sources.  
   5. **Third-Party Terms:** Your use of any Firefly App or external service may be subject to separate terms and conditions or privacy policies of the third-party provider. **It is your responsibility to review and understand any third-party terms before using their services.** This EULA does not govern the relationship between you and third-party providers. Nirvana’s role is simply to provide the infrastructure (the Platform) that can host or link to these external services for your convenience.

Nirvana strives to curate a trustworthy ecosystem (for instance, by allowing only vetted providers to publish on Firefly and by applying the Nirvana Standard filter to products), but **Nirvana does not continuously monitor or guarantee third-party content**. Nirvana may, at its discretion, remove or restrict access to any third-party app or content that violates our policies or the law, but the primary oversight of third-party services lies with their publishers and your FI’s configuration. **You acknowledge that by using third-party apps or content, you are assuming all associated risks without recourse to Nirvana.** Nirvana **disclaims any and all liability for third-party offerings**, and you agree that you will not hold Nirvana responsible for any aspect of third-party services accessed through the Platform.

15. **Disclaimers of Warranties**

**The Nirvana Platform is provided to you on an “as is” and “as available” basis.** To the fullest extent permitted by law, Nirvana and its affiliates **disclaim all warranties and representations, express or implied, regarding the Platform and any content or search analytics provided**. 

Without limiting the foregoing, **Nirvana assumes no fiduciary, advisory, equitable or common-law duty toward any Member.** Your sole relationship with Nirvana is that of licensee to software provider.

This includes, but is not limited to, the following disclaimers:

1. **No Warranty of Accuracy or Completeness:** Nirvana does not warrant that the information, search analytics, or results provided on the Platform are correct, accurate, complete, or up-to-date. **There may be errors, omissions, or inaccuracies** in data or computations. All information is provided for general informational purposes with no guarantee of accuracy. You use and rely on the Platform’s information **at your own risk**. Nirvana expressly disclaims any liability for **errors or omissions** in the content or search analytics provided​.  
   2. **No Warranty of Performance or Results:** Nirvana makes no guarantee that the use of the Platform or any analytic tools will improve your investment performance or financial results. **Any expected outcomes, scores, or results are speculative and contingent on many factors outside Nirvana’s control.** The Platform’s outputs are **not predictions**, and Nirvana does not warrant that following or using these outputs will produce any particular outcome for you.  
   3. **No Warranty of Merchantability or Fitness:** Nirvana disclaims any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the Platform is suitable for your specific needs, goals, or expectations. You are solely responsible for determining whether the services provided are appropriate for your use.  
   4. **No Warranty of Availability or Error-Free Operation:** Nirvana does not warrant that the Platform (including the FI App, Satya, Proximity, and all features) will be available at all times or without interruption, nor that the Platform will be secure or free of errors, bugs, viruses, or other harmful components. Technical issues or maintenance may result in temporary service outages. Nirvana will try to maintain reliable operations but **does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted access**.  
   5. **No Creation of Warranty by Information:** No advice or information (oral or written) obtained by you from Nirvana, your FI, or through the Platform shall create any warranty not expressly stated in this EULA.  
   6. **No Duty of Care.** Nirvana provides purely impersonal analytical data and does **not** owe you any duty of care, fiduciary duty, or similar obligation under common law, equity, or statute. You acknowledge that you alone remain responsible for all investment and financial decisions.  
   7. **No Obligation to Update.** Nirvana is under no obligation to update, correct, or continue to provide any particular dataset, model, or analytic output, and may discontinue or modify any feature at any time without notice or  liability.  
   8. **Forward-Looking Information.** Any estimates, projections, or forward-looking statements generated by the Platform are speculative, reflect numerous assumptions, and may prove inaccurate. Actual outcomes may differ materially; you should not place reliance upon them.  
   9. **Hypothetical or simulated returns** do **not** represent actual trading and may under- or over-state performance. No scenario analysis, stress test, or projected Compass-Score provides any guarantee against loss.  
   10. **You assume full responsibility for your use of the Platform.** Other than any express warranties stated in this Agreement, **Nirvana provides no other warranties of any kind.** Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so some of the above disclaimers may not apply to you to the extent prohibited by law. In such cases, warranties are disclaimed to the maximum extent permitted.  
   11. **Important:** Nirvana is **not** offering any professional advice or service other than the provision of the software Platform. **Nirvana is not a financial advisor, and no communications from Nirvana (including Satya’s outputs, search analytics, or any other content) should be interpreted as financial, legal, tax, or investment advice.** Always consult qualified professionals (such as your FI, attorneys, or tax advisors) for advice pertaining to your circumstances.  
   12. **Experimental or Beta features.** From time to time the Platform may expose **alpha, preview, early-access or beta** features. These are provided **as-is**, may be modified or discontinued without notice, **are excluded from any indemnity**, and may be subject to additional terms. Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with any Experimental or Beta feature is to stop using it.

Each disclaimer in this Section operates independently; if any part is held invalid, the remainder shall continue in full force.

16. **Limitation of Liability**

**To the maximum extent permitted by law, Nirvana (and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents)** shall **in no event be liable for punitive, exemplary, special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Platform or any information, search analytics, or services provided through it.** This exclusion of liability applies to all categories of damages, whether in an action based on contract, warranty, equity, negligence, strict liability, or other tort, statute or regulation. The limitations and exclusions in this Section apply to all claims arising out of or relating to the Platform or its outputs across all domains, whether financial or non-financial.  For the avoidance of doubt, these exclusions and caps apply to any claim based on alleged failure to warn, failure to disclose, omission, silence, partial information, or inconsistency across different communications or sessions. In particular, **Nirvana shall not be liable to you or any third party for:**

1. **Indirect or Consequential Losses:** Any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, **even if Nirvana has been advised of the possibility of such damages**. This includes, without limitation, any loss of opportunity, loss of goodwill, business interruption, or other intangible losses.  
   2. **Loss of Profits or Investment Losses:** Any loss of profits, loss of savings or expected profits, loss of investment principal, or other financial losses resulting from decisions you made based on information or search analytics from the Platform. **Nirvana will not be liable for any losses in your investment portfolio or financial accounts, even if such losses are claimed to be caused by reliance on the Platform’s outputs.** You fully assume the risk of any investment decisions or trades you conduct after using the Platform.  
   3. **Data or Information Loss:** Any loss, damage, or corruption of data. Nirvana is not liable for the loss or disclosure of any personal or financial information input into the Platform, or for the consequences of any unauthorized access to your data, except to the extent mandated by law. (Nirvana does employ security measures to protect data, but no system is infallible.)  
   4. **Third-Party Claims or Damages:** Any damages or claims arising from third-party services or content (including Firefly Apps) accessed through the Platform. For example, if a third-party app malfunctions or gives faulty advice that causes you loss, Nirvana is not responsible for those damages. Similarly, if a third-party brings a claim against you due to your actions or content on the Platform, Nirvana is not liable for that dispute.    
   5. These limitations apply regardless of whether any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose and even if Nirvana or its representatives have been advised of the possibility of such damages. You acknowledge that this limitation of liability is a fundamental part of the bargain and a necessary allocation of risk for the services provided, which would not be available to you without these limitations.  
   6. **Monetary Cap on Liability:** To the extent that any liability of Nirvana is not entirely excluded by the provisions above, in no event shall Nirvana’s total cumulative liability to you for any and all claims arising out of or relating to this EULA or your use of the Platform **exceed the total amount of fees you have paid to Nirvana (if any) for the use of the Platform in the twelve (12) months immediately prior to the event giving rise to the claim**. If you have paid no such fees (for example, if the service was provided free or fees were paid by your FI), Nirvana’s total liability shall not exceed **USD $100**. This monetary cap applies **in the aggregate** and **survives termination** of this Agreement.  
   7. **Exceptions:** Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If the law of such a jurisdiction applies to you, some of the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to the extent prohibited by law. Nirvana does not seek to exclude or limit liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or any other liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law (for example, certain statutory liabilities).  
   8. **Sole Remedy:** If you are dissatisfied with any aspect of the Platform or do not agree with this EULA, **your sole and exclusive remedy is to stop using the Platform and terminate your subscription.** You agree that the limitations of liability and disclaimers in this EULA will survive and apply even if any limited remedy is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

   

17. **Indemnification**

You agree to **indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Nirvana, its parent company, affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents** (collectively, the “Nirvana Parties”) from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that arise out of or relate to:

1. **Your Violation of this Agreement or Law:** Any breach by you of any term of this EULA, or your violation of any applicable law or regulation in connection with your use of the Platform. For example, if you use the Platform in an unlawful manner or violate securities laws in reliance on the Platform, you will indemnify the Nirvana Parties for any resulting damages or penalties.  
   2. **Your Use of the Platform:** Your use or misuse of the Platform, including any actions you take (or fail to take) based on the search analytics or information provided. This covers any claim or loss stemming from your investment decisions, trading activities, or other conduct that you engage in after obtaining information from the Platform. **If you allege that you suffered a loss due to an error or issue with the Platform, you agree that Nirvana is not liable, but if a third party (for example, a client of yours or another person affected by your investment activities) makes a claim against a Nirvana Party because of your use of the Platform, you will cover all costs of that claim.**  
   3. **Your reliance on non-financial outputs:** any claim arising from your use of, or reliance on, Satya’s content in **health, mental-health, legal, tax, safety, engineering, education, employment, or other non-financial contexts**, including decisions affecting your or others’ welfare.  
   4. **Third-Party Services and Content:** Your interactions with or use of any third-party apps, content, or services accessed via Nirvana. If, for instance, you infringe someone’s rights or cause harm using a third-party Firefly App, or if you have a dispute with a third-party provider, and any Nirvana Party is pursued as a result, you will indemnify the Nirvana Parties.  
   5. **Misrepresentation or Inaccurate Information:** Any false, misleading, or inaccurate information provided by you (or through Satya on your behalf) to the Platform, and the consequences thereof. You are responsible for the data you input; if incorrect input leads to any claim or damage (for example, if it causes improper search analytics that you rely on or that mislead your FI or other users), you will bear responsibility for it.

Nirvana reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. In that case, you agree to cooperate with Nirvana’s defense of such claim and you will not settle any such matter without Nirvana’s prior written consent. This indemnification obligation shall survive any termination or expiration of this EULA.

Through this indemnity, you are effectively agreeing that **Nirvana will not be held financially responsible for issues that arise because of your use of the Platform**, and if any Nirvana Party incurs costs due to your actions or use, you will reimburse those costs. This allocation of responsibility is part of the consideration for the access to the Platform provided to you.

18.  **Governing law and dispute resolution**

    1. **Governing law:** This EULA, together with any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it, is governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of Bermuda.  
    2. **Mandatory arbitration**  
       1. **Scope.** Every dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination (each, a *Dispute*), shall be finally resolved by arbitration.  
       2. **Institution and rules.** The arbitration shall be administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (*ICC*) and conducted in accordance with the ICC Rules of Arbitration (*ICC Rules*) in force on the date the Notice of Arbitration is submitted.  
       3. **Seat and language.** The legal seat of the arbitration is Hamilton, Bermuda. The proceedings shall be conducted in English.  
       4. **Tribunal composition:** (a) Where the aggregated value of all claims and counter-claims, inclusive of interest and costs, is less than United States dollars one million (USD 1,000,000), the arbitration shall proceed under the ICC Expedited Rules before a sole arbitrator; (b) In all other cases the tribunal shall comprise three arbitrators; (c) Each arbitrator shall possess demonstrable expertise in financial technology, quantitative finance, or enterprise software.  
       5. **Interim and emergency relief.** Either Party may seek interim, conservatory, or emergency measures from (i) an ICC emergency arbitrator or (ii) any court of competent jurisdiction, without prejudice to this agreement to arbitrate.  
       6. **Confidentiality.** The existence of the arbitration, all pleadings, evidence, transcripts, and any award are confidential and may be disclosed only to the extent necessary to enforce rights, comply with legal or regulatory duties, consult professional advisers, or obtain insurance or reinsurance.  
       7. **Costs.** Unless the tribunal considers another allocation more equitable, the prevailing Party shall be awarded all reasonable legal costs, tribunal fees, and disbursements, together with interest from the date such costs are incurred until payment. Where the claimant is neither incorporated nor habitually resident in Bermuda and the amount in dispute exceeds USD 10,000, the tribunal may order the claimant to provide appropriate security for costs.  
       8. **Award.** The award shall be final and binding on the Parties and may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York, 1958).

       

19. **Nirvana small-claim option:** Nirvana may, at its sole election, bring monetary claims whose total value, inclusive of interest and costs, does not exceed United States dollars one hundred thousand (USD 100,000) before the Magistrates’ Court of Bermuda. The pursuit or defence of such proceedings does not waive any other provision of this Section 15\.

20. **Personal jurisdiction and service of process**  
    1. For the purposes of interim or conservatory measures, compelling arbitration, or the recognition or enforcement of an arbitral award, each Party irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Bermuda and of any court that would otherwise have jurisdiction over that Party or its assets, and waives any objection to venue or forum non conveniens.  
    2. A Party that is neither incorporated nor habitually resident in Bermuda shall, within ten (10) Business Days of the Effective Date, appoint and thereafter maintain a Bermuda-based agent authorised to accept service of process on its behalf and shall notify the other Party in writing of that appointment.  
    3. Service of any writ, summons, petition, notice, or other document (*Process*) may be effected by delivery to that process agent, by prepaid recorded post or internationally recognised courier to the Party’s registered or principal business address, or by electronic mail to the address specified for notices in this Agreement. Process so served is deemed received (i) five (5) Business Days after dispatch by post or courier, or (ii) at the time of transmission if sent by e-mail during the recipient’s normal business hours. Failure to appoint or maintain a process agent does not affect the validity of service otherwise effected in accordance with this clause.

    

21. **Class-action and representative-action waiver.** To the fullest extent permitted by law, **each Party irrevocably waives any right to act as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated, representative, group, private attorney-general (including PAGA), or mass arbitration or litigation** against the other Party. The tribunal may **adjudicate only individual claims** and **may not consolidate** more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of representative proceeding. **If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that this waiver is unenforceable with respect to a particular claim (for example, a non-waivable claim for public injunctive relief), that claim must be severed and litigated in a court; all remaining claims shall proceed in arbitration on an individual basis.** This waiver is an essential basis of the bargain and shall survive termination.

22. **Mass-arbitration protocol.** If **50 or more** substantially similar individual arbitration demands are filed by or with the same counsel within a 90-day period, the Parties shall (i) **batch** them in groups of up to **50** for sequential resolution; (ii) select **10 bellwethers** from the first batch to proceed first; (iii) **stay** the remainder; and (iv) in good faith use the bellwether outcomes to resolve or schedule the rest. The tribunal may make administrative-fee allocations and scheduling orders to avoid undue burden on either Party.

23. **Limitation period.** Any claim arising out of or relating to the Platform or this Agreement **must be commenced within thirty (30) days after**the output or event giving rise to the claim was first displayed to you in the Platform; claims brought thereafter are permanently barred.  
  


24. **Exclusion of CISG:** The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) does not apply to this Agreement or to any Dispute.  
  


25. **Waiver of immunity:** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Party irrevocably waives any sovereign, state, or other immunity, whether as to adjudication or execution, in relation to proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

26. The provisions of Section 15 shall survive **termination of the Member’s licence to use the Platform, closure of the Member’s account, or any other cessation of the Member’s use of the Platform** and shall remain in force for ten (10) years thereafter. Section 15 prevails over any conflicting dispute-resolution provisions in any ancillary agreement between the Parties.  
  


27. **Miscellaneous Provisions**  
  


    1. **Entire Agreement:** This EULA (including any documents or policies incorporated by reference) constitutes the **entire agreement** between you and Nirvana regarding the use of the Platform. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, or communications (whether oral or written) between you and Nirvana relating to the subject matter hereof. **No other representations or terms shall be binding** on the parties unless explicitly agreed in writing. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any representation or warranty not expressly included in this EULA.  
    2. **Entire-Agreement Reliance.** You acknowledge you have **not** relied on any statement, representation, or warranty that is not expressly set out in this EULA (including any chat transcripts, marketing materials, or informal explanations).  
    3. **Hierarchy.** As between you and Nirvana, this EULA prevails over the Website Terms and over any agreement between Nirvana and an FI or Firefly publisher to the extent of any inconsistency.  
    4. **Amendments:** Nirvana may update or modify the terms of this EULA from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you via the FI App, email, or other conspicuous means. **Your continued use of the Platform after the effective date of any modifications constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.** If you do not agree to the revised terms, you must stop using the Platform and, if applicable, cancel your subscription. Except as described above, this EULA may not be amended or modified except by a written agreement signed by both you and an authorized representative of Nirvana.  
    5. **Severability:** If any provision of this EULA is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of this EULA will remain in full force and effect. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith a valid, enforceable substitute provision that most nearly effects the parties’ original intent and allocation of risk, if any part of this EULA is found invalid.  
    6. **No Waiver:** No failure or delay by Nirvana in exercising any right, power, or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy. Similarly, Nirvana’s single or partial exercise of any right or remedy does not prevent it from any further exercise of the same or some other right or remedy. **Any waiver of a provision of this EULA will be effective only if in writing and signed by Nirvana.**

    

28. **Assignment:** You may **not assign or transfer** this EULA or any of your rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without Nirvana’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign this Agreement without consent is null. Nirvana may freely assign or transfer this EULA (in whole or in part) to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. This EULA will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.

29. **No Third-Party Beneficiaries:** Except as expressly provided herein (for example, the indemnified Nirvana Parties, which include affiliates and agents), this Agreement is solely for the benefit of you and Nirvana. It is not intended to confer any rights or remedies on any third party, including any of your clients or any user of a third-party app.

    

30. **App-store terms.** If you download a mobile app from Apple or Google, the relevant store may be a third-party beneficiary of this EULA to the extent its terms require. This EULA governs your relationship with Nirvana.

31. **Headings and Interpretation:** Section headings in this EULA are for convenience only and have no legal effect. In this EULA, the words “including” and “include” mean “including, but not limited to.” Any ambiguity in this EULA shall not be construed against the drafter (Nirvana) solely by virtue of authorship.

    

32. **Export controls and sanctions.** You will not use the Platform in violation of applicable export-control or sanctions laws and you represent that you are not a sanctioned person or located in a sanctioned jurisdiction.

33. **Notices:** Legal notices to Nirvana may be sent to the registered office stated in the Definitions. Nirvana may send you notices by email to the address associated with your account, via in-app notification, or through other reasonable means. You are responsible for keeping your contact information up to date. Notices shall be deemed given (a) when received if personally delivered or sent by certified mail; or (b) when sent if delivered electronically (provided no bounce or error message is received).

34. **Force Majeure:** Nirvana will not be liable for any delay or failure in performance of the Platform arising out of any cause beyond Nirvana’s reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, cyber-attacks, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, network infrastructure failures, strikes or shortages of transportation, facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials.

By accepting this EULA, you acknowledge that you have read and understood all its terms, including the disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability, arbitration agreement, and choice of law provisions. **You represent that you have the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement**. If you are accepting on behalf of an organization or another person, you confirm that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms.

Thank you for reviewing this End User Licence Agreement. If you have any questions about these terms, please contact your FI or Nirvana support before proceeding. **Your use of the Nirvana Platform signifies your consent to this Agreement.**

**SCHEDULE A – Territorial compliance and jurisdiction-specific disclaimers**

*(This Schedule forms part of the EULA and is incorporated by reference in Section 4\)*

**A \- Canada**

Nirvana is **not registered** under securities legislation of any province or territory of Canada. The Platform is provided to you as an **impersonal data-processing and search service**. Nirvana is **not registered** under provincial securities laws and does not “advise in securities” or “deal in securities”. Outputs are general information and identical for identical queries; they are not tailored to your circumstances and must not be treated as advice. Nirvana does **not** (i) advise in securities within the meaning of National Instrument 31-103, (ii) engage in any “dealing” activity, or (iii) carry on business within Canada that would require registration. Any analytic output is general in nature, does not consider the “know-your-client” information your adviser maintains, and must be interpreted or validated by that adviser before implementation.

   
**Precedence of territorial terms.** If a term in this Schedule A conflicts with the body of the Agreement, the territorial term prevails for Members resident in that jurisdiction. In a consumer context, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer applies to the extent required by law.

**Governing law; venue.** For Members habitually resident in Canada acting for personal, family, or household purposes, this Agreement is governed by the laws of the province or territory of your residence and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. Any dispute may be brought in the courts of that province or territory, and Nirvana submits to their jurisdiction.

**Arbitration/class-action waiver inapplicable to consumers.** Any mandatory arbitration requirement, foreign seat, or class/representative-action waiver does not apply to Canadian consumers to the extent prohibited by applicable consumer-protection law (including in Ontario and Quebec). Your statutory rights to bring an action in court and to participate in a class proceeding are preserved.

**Limitation period.** Any contractual limitation period is replaced by the minimum limitation period mandated by the law of your province or territory.

**Language (Quebec).** A French version of this Agreement is available and is presented first to Quebec consumers. After reviewing the French version, a Quebec consumer may expressly choose to be bound by a version in another language. In the event of any discrepancy for Quebec consumers, the French version prevails to the extent required by law.

**Pricing transparency (Competition Act).** Advertised prices for Canadian consumers include all non-optional fees; applicable sales taxes are disclosed clearly before purchase.

**Auto-renewal and cancellation.** Before you purchase we disclose the price, billing interval, renewal, and how to cancel. You may cancel online at any time. Where a province requires an advance renewal reminder or additional disclosures for distance contracts, Nirvana will provide them in the form and timing required.

**Distance contracts (Ontario and Quebec).** Before acceptance, Nirvana or its merchant-of-record provides all required pre-contract disclosures and an opportunity to correct errors; a copy of the contract is delivered in a durable form within the period required by law.

**Commercial electronic messages (CASL).** Promotional emails or messages are sent only with consent and include clear sender identification and a functioning unsubscribe.

**Privacy (PIPEDA; Quebec Law 25).** Personal information may be processed outside Canada. We obtain meaningful consent, identify our Privacy Officer, and honour access/rectification rights. For Quebec residents, we perform privacy impact assessments for cross-border transfers and automated processing that produces a decision based on personal information and provide the transparency required by Law 25\.

**Sales taxes.** Nirvana or its merchant-of-record collects and remits applicable Canadian sales taxes (including GST/HST, QST, and PST where applicable) and displays CAD amounts to Canadian consumers.  
**Payment method.** Subscriptions are charged to a payment card. If Nirvana offers bank-account pre-authorised debits in Canada, they will be governed by a separate PAD agreement compliant with Payments Canada Rule H1.

**Canada regulatory status (securities).** Outputs are impersonal search results/publications of general and regular circulation and are not tailored to your circumstances; Nirvana does not advise in, deal in, or intermediate securities. Consult a licensed firm before acting on any output.

**Regulatory status and mode gating (securities).** In Canada direct-to-consumer, the Platform operates in **Search** mode only; **Search+** is available solely when the Member connects a licensed firm.

**A-1 United States (consumers and small businesses)**

**Nature of service.** Nirvana is an impersonal **search and analytics** service. It surfaces a catalogue of eligible financial products and Firefly Apps in response to **Member-selected search parameters**. Outputs are publications of general and regular circulation; they are **not** investment advice, personal recommendations, or portfolio management.

**No individualisation in search results display order.** Display order and any displayed indices (including the Compass Score) use only the Member-selected **search parameters** together with system-wide criteria and datasets. They do **not** use a Member’s financial situation, holdings, risk profile, history, cookies, or behavioural signals. **Within the same Catalogue Snapshot and Algorithm Version, identical inputs produce identical outputs and ordering.**

**Auto-renewal and cancellation (ROSCA/state ARLs).** For Members resident in the United States, Nirvana complies with the federal Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act and applicable state automatic-renewal laws. Material terms (price, interval, renewal, how to cancel, trial conversion date) are presented clearly and conspicuously at checkout; you provide **affirmative consent** to recurring charges; a **post-purchase acknowledgement** is sent; and you may **cancel online, at any time, by the same method used to enrol** (for example, Account → Manage subscription). Where a state law (including California or New York) mandates additional or different notices or mechanisms—such as advance renewal reminders for long terms—those requirements are incorporated here and **prevail** for residents of that state.

**Regulatory status.** Nirvana is **not** an investment adviser, broker, or money transmitter, and the Platform does not solicit or effect transactions. Members should obtain advice from a licensed firm before acting on any information.

**Consumer protections.** Any mandatory consumer right provided by US federal or state law that cannot be waived applies notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the EULA (including warranty, limitation-of-liability, venue, and arbitration provisions).

**A-2 United Kingdom**

Nirvana is **not authorised** by the Financial Conduct Authority under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000\. Nirvana is not authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority. The services are unregulated software and search/analytics and do not constitute “investment advice”, “arranging deals”, or “portfolio management”. Outputs are impersonal publications of general and regular circulation; they are not personal recommendations. The services described herein are classified as *unregulated software and data-analytics services* and do **not** constitute (i) investment advice under section 21 FSMA, (ii) arrangement of deals, or (iii) portfolio management. Members resident in the UK receive the Platform strictly on an *execution-only/ information-only* basis through their FCA-authorised adviser, who remains solely responsible for suitability and disclosure obligations.

**A-3 European Union (MiFID II area)**

Nirvana is **not authorised** by any EU competent authority pursuant to Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) and does **not** provide “investment services and activities” as defined in Annex I of that Directive. Nirvana is **not authorised** by an EU competent authority and does not provide “investment services and activities” within Annex I of MiFID II. Outputs are **impersonal search/search analytics publications** and are **not** personal recommendations. Members must obtain advice from a licensed firm before acting. The analytical tools are furnished on a reverse-solicitation basis to a licensed investment firm acting on your behalf; they therefore fall outside the territorial scope of MiFID II under Article 42\. No contract for investment advice, execution or reception/transmission of orders is formed between you and Nirvana.

**A-4 Japan**

Nirvana is **not registered** under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and does **not** conduct Investment Advisory and Agency Business in Japan. All algorithmic outputs are **general information** supplied cross-border to your duly registered Japanese financial instruments business operator. You acknowledge that no part of the Platform solicits or recommends the purchase or sale of any financial instrument within Japan.

**A-5 People’s Republic of China (mainland)**

Nirvana holds **no licence** from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the People’s Bank of China, or the National Internet Finance Association. The Platform is a *technical, data-processing facility* located outside the PRC and is accessed at the **sole initiative** of your licensed mainland adviser. No service herein constitutes “securities investment consulting” under the Securities Law of the PRC, and no invitation to transact in securities is made to PRC residents.

**A-6 India**

Nirvana is **not registered** with the Securities and Exchange Board of India under the SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations 2013\. The Platform supplies impersonal search analytics to your SEBI-registered adviser and does **not** amount to “investment advice” or “portfolio management services” within the meaning of SEBI rules. You must rely on your adviser for any personalised recommendation.

**A-7 Cayman Islands**

Nirvana is **not licensed** by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority and does **not** carry on “securities investment business” as defined in the Securities Investment Business Act (2020 Revision). Platform outputs are limited to software-generated search analytics delivered to or at the direction of your licensed service provider; no invitation or solicitation is made by Nirvana to the Cayman public.

**SCHEDULE B – How Analemma Fees work (informative only)**

**Regulatory clarification.** Analemma Fees and Invocation Fees compensate Nirvana solely for computation and data processing. They are payable irrespective of whether you, your FI, or any third party subsequently execute any trade or investment.

**Why an Analemma Fee can be a net benefit for you as a Member**

**What Analemma does**: Think of Analemma as an “orchestration layer” that can combine the expertise of several Firefly Apps into **one integrated analytic output**. Instead of you (or your adviser) launching each App sequentially—paying a separate Invocation Fee, waiting for each result, and then trying to reconcile overlapping or conflicting information—Analemma chains those Apps together in a single background workflow. The composite run:

* **Eliminates duplication** (e.g., one App optimises tax-loss harvesting while another adds an ESG tilt, and a third adjusts downside protection; Analemma ensures the algorithms work in concert, not at cross-purposes).  
* **Delivers a consolidated Compass-Score uplift** measured once at the end of the orchestration, so you see one net improvement figure rather than three uncoordinated deltas.  
* **Avoids multiple Invocation Fees**: you pay just the one Analemma Fee instead of separate Invocation Fees for every App in the composite run.  
* **Captures economies of scale** in AI processing and cloud-compute usage; the metered cost is typically lower than running the same Apps individually.

**Why the fee is metered**: Because Analemma spins up several models, aggregates intermediate outputs, and reconciles them into a single analytic, the compute load is higher than a single-App invocation. The fee is therefore linked to the actual resources consumed (GPU time, memory, inference cycles, carbon offset) rather than a flat price.  An outlier price can never raise your cost: any Invocation Fee above one point five (1.5) × the recent median for its category is automatically replaced by that capped amount before your fee is calculated.

**Transparency and non-auditable billing**

* **Final, logged calculation**: the metering engine records the resources used and calculates the charge automatically; that figure is included in your monthly statement.  
* **No manual overrides**: because the calculation is fully algorithmic and audit-logged, there is no human discretion that could lead to inconsistent charging.
