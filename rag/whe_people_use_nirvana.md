**Why people use Nirvana**

Nirvana is a general search engine for finance. We are here to provide answers, and we answer only to you. We are not paid for product placements or to promote anyone’s offerings. We exist to give you the information you care about in an honest, transparent and neutral manner.  There is no “Artificial Intelligence” used to generate search results; AI is used only to help you state search parameters.  Therefore, you can trust that given the same data, the same search with the same parameters will generate the same results.

The vast majority of people care first and foremost about the size of possible losses when markets fall, and everyone has a personal limit. 

Yet the advisory industry does not recommend investments built around a customer’s personal loss limit. Instead, it relies on “risk” labels that describe day-to-day price fluctuations. Low day-to-day price fluctuations do not tell you whether an investment could breach your loss tolerance, or by how much.  This is a mismatch.

**Low volatility does not mean low loss potential,** 

**nor does it tell you how “bad” bad could be.**

History shows that even highly rated, mainstream funds can suffer deep losses, regardless of their marketing labels.  As an example, based on current data, even best-in-class Morningstar 5-Star and Gold medal jointly-rated US mutual funds’ expected loss in across **down years** is between \-11.5% to \-8.5%, across **5% worst** years is \-28% to \-22% and across **1% worst** years is \-36% to \-29%, with 10% of the mutual funds show possible average loss levels between \-67% to \-54%\*.

Nirvana enables you to:

1) see the size of possible losses across your existing holdings;  
2) see a catalogue of different products that have historically respected your acceptable loss limits and other search parameters you choose; and  
3) explore combinations of products to see how different mixes might have behaved against your chosen search queries, which may include loss limits.

Results are ordered by our search relevance index, the **Compass Score**, which ranks eligible items by relevance to your search query. It is not advice, not a recommendation, and not an assessment of personal suitability. Identical inputs produce identical outputs. There are no commissions and no paid placements \- just clear, reproducible search results you can understand.

\*(Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) \- also known as Expected Shortfall \- is a measure of “how bad things can get on average when events turn out to be truly poor.” You begin by deciding what counts as truly poor, for example the worst one per cent of possible outcomes. CVaR then looks only at that narrow band of dire scenarios and reports the expected loss within it.

Legend: “down years” \= average loss conditional on a negative one-year return; “5% worst years” \= 1-year Expected Shortfall (CVaR) at the 95% level; “1% worst years” \= 1-year Expected Shortfall (CVaR) at the 99% level, all computed on the Morningstar 5-Star and Gold medal US mutual-fund cohort as of 19 August 2025. **Ratings notice:** Morningstar star ratings are based on past, risk-adjusted performance and may change. **Performance notice:** Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.)
