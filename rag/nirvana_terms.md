**Nirvana \- Public Terms of Use**

**Effective date:** 29 August 2025

**Entity:** Nirvana X Limited, an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of Bermuda, with its principal place of business at c/o Conyers Corporate Services (Bermuda) Limited, Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM11, Bermuda (“**Nirvana**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”).

**1\. Acceptance of these Terms**

By accessing or using any Nirvana website, page, feed, API, or widget that we make publicly available (collectively, the “**Site**”), you agree to be bound by these Public Terms of Use (the “**Terms**”). If you do not agree, you must not use the Site. If you use any interactive features (for example, portfolio import), we may present a click-wrap notice; by proceeding you agree to these Terms.

**2\. What the Site is (and is not)**

2.1 **Impersonal analytics only.** The Site publishes **impersonal, parameterised analytics** and market information, including **quantitative indices and loss-threshold measures** (together, the “Analytics”). Analytics are computed to stated parameters (for example, loss tolerance, horizon, confidence level, and lookback window) and are **identical for anyone using the same inputs**. **Nirvana does not assess whether any user-selected parameters are appropriate**. Analytics, including any displayed search relevance index, the Compass Score, are computed using deterministic, rules-based methods; Satya is used solely to translate natural-language requests into parameters and does not evaluate any person’s circumstances.

2.2 **No advice; no personal recommendation.** The Site does **not** provide investment, legal, tax, accounting, or other professional advice; does **not** make a suitability assessment; and does **not** make a personal recommendation or an offer or solicitation to buy or sell any financial product.

2.3 **No special relationship; no duty of care.** Your use of the Site does **not** create any fiduciary, advisory, client, or other special relationship with Nirvana. We **do not** undertake, assume, or accept any duty of care to you in respect of the Site or the Analytics.

2.4 **Satya query interpretation.** Natural-language requests made via Satya are **translated into search parameters** that are then applied mechanically to compute Analytics. **Identical requests yield identical outputs for any user.** Satya **does not** evaluate a user’s circumstances, goals, or suitability, and **does not** provide recommendations.

**3\. Eligibility and account status**

The Site is intended for persons aged eighteen (18) years or older. Certain features may require registration. If you register or access any paid or gated functionality, the **Nirvana Member End User Licence Agreement (EULA)** applies. If there is any overlap or conflict between these Public Terms and the EULA, the EULA prevails.

**4\. Permitted use and restrictions**

4.1 **Licence.** Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to access and display the Site for your own informational purposes.

4.2 **Prohibited conduct.** You must not: (a) rely on the Site as advice; (b) represent or present Analytics as **personalised investment advice** or **suitability determinations**; (c) use, copy, scrape, cache, mirror, frame, index, or distribute the Site or Analytics except as expressly permitted; (d) remove notices, or falsify attributions; (e) use the Site to create, market, or benchmark financial products or indices without our written consent; (f) use the Site or outputs to train or fine-tune models or datasets without our written consent; (g) interfere with or degrade the Site; (h) circumvent access or geographic controls; or (i) use the Site in breach of law, regulation, or third-party rights.

**5\. Information quality; “as is”; as-of times**

5.1 **No warranties.** The Site and Analytics are provided “**as is**” and “**as available**”. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, representations, and conditions, express or implied, including accuracy, completeness, timeliness, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.  Outputs generated using automated or AI-assisted systems may contain errors or omissions.

5.2 **As-of and parameters.** We may display as-of timestamps (UTC), horizons, confidence levels, and lookback windows. Figures may be delayed, incomplete, or erroneous, and may change without notice. We have no obligation to update, correct, or continue to publish any item.

5.3 **Third-party sources.** Data may be obtained from third parties. We are not responsible for third-party content, availability, or errors.

**6\. Advertising; independence; third-party links**

6.1 **Advertising.** The Site may display third-party advertisements. Advertising has **no influence** on the calculation, inclusion, weighting, ranking, or presentation of Analytics. We do **not** accept any payment, referral fee, or commission in exchange for coverage, scoring, or placement of any financial instrument. Advertisements are clearly labelled and kept separate from Analytics.

6.2 **No endorsement.** References to any instrument, issuer, venue, or service are for identification only and do not constitute endorsement or approval.

6.3 **Third-party sites.** Links to third-party sites are provided for convenience and are outside our control; you access them at your sole risk.

**7\. No circumvention. No offer.**

7.1 **No circumvention.** You shall not use VPNs or other means to circumvent geographic access controls we implement to comply with law or territorial feature gating. Certain features may be unavailable in your jurisdiction. See the Member EULA for details.

7.2 **No offer.** Content on the Site is not an offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful.

**8\. Privacy; portfolio imports**

8.1 **Privacy.** Our **Privacy Notice** explains what data we collect and how we process it. To evidence reproducibility and for safety/compliance, Nirvana may log **hashed or pseudonymised** representations of input parameters and system outputs.

8.2 **Portfolio imports.** If you upload or connect portfolio data, you represent that you have the right to do so and you instruct us to process it to compute Analytics. Unless we expressly state otherwise, we design portfolio-import features to avoid long-term retention; however, transient processing and short-term operational logs may occur. You are responsible for exporting, backing up, and deleting your data where applicable.

**9\. Intellectual property; feedback**

9.1 **Ownership.** The Site, Analytics, software, designs, text, logos, and content are owned by or licensed to Nirvana and are protected by law.

9.2 **No implied rights.** Except for the limited licence in Section 4.1, no rights are granted by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

9.3 **Feedback.** If you provide ideas or feedback, you grant Nirvana a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use and exploit them without restriction or attribution.

**10\. No reliance; your responsibilities**

10.1 **No reliance.** You agree that you will **not** rely upon the Site or Analytics for investment or other decisions. You will obtain independent financial, legal, tax, and accounting advice from qualified professionals.

10.2 **Your decisions, your risk.** You are solely responsible for any decisions or actions you take based on your own judgement.

**11\. Limitation of liability**

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

(a) **Exclusions.** Nirvana and its affiliates, officers, employees, contractors, and agents shall **not** be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, or for loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, or data, arising out of or relating to the Site or these Terms, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

(b) **Cap.** Our aggregate liability for all claims arising out of or relating to the Site or these Terms shall not exceed **USD 100**.

(c) **Non-excludable liabilities.** Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

**(d) Members.** If you are a logged-in Member, the liability limits and exclusions in the Member EULA govern your relationship with Nirvana. In any overlap or conflict, the EULA prevails.

**12\. Indemnity**

You shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Nirvana and its affiliates, officers, employees, contractors, and agents from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your breach of these Terms; (b) your misuse of the Site or Analytics; or (c) your violation of law or third-party rights.

**13\. Dispute resolution; class-action waiver; governing law**

13.1 **Informal resolution first.** Before commencing formal proceedings, you agree to email **legal@nirvana.bm** with “Legal Notice” in the subject line and to attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith for thirty (30) days.

13.2 **Arbitration.** Except where prohibited by law, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Site shall be finally resolved by confidential arbitration administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in accordance with the ICC Rules of Arbitration then in force. The legal seat of the arbitration is Hamilton, Bermuda. The proceedings shall be conducted in English before a sole arbitrator, unless the ICC Rules require otherwise. The award shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

13.3 **Class/collective waiver (where permitted by law).** Proceedings shall be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, or representative action.

13.4 **Governing law; consumer carve-out.** These Terms and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with them are governed by the laws of **Bermuda**, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. If you are a consumer and the laws of your country of residence provide you with mandatory protections that cannot be waived, those protections remain in force.

**14\. Changes; suspension**

We may modify the Site or these Terms at any time. The “Effective date” will be updated when changes are made. Your continued use of the Site after changes become effective constitutes acceptance. We may suspend or withdraw the Site, or your access to it, at any time and for any reason.

**15\. Takedown and corrections**

If you believe any content is unlawful, infringes rights, or is factually inaccurate, please email [**legal@nirvana.bm**](mailto:legal@nirvana.bm) with details. We may investigate and take action in our discretion without admitting liability or obligation.

**16\. Force majeure**

We are not responsible for any failure or delay due to causes beyond our reasonable control, including acts of God, labour disputes, internet failures, power outages, cyber incidents, or acts of government.

**17**. **Fees and payment.** 

Fees, billing cycles, renewals, refunds, taxes, and the Merchant-of-Record payments model are governed by the Nirvana Member End User Licence Agreement (EULA).** **For transparency: consumer subscriptions are billed annually in advance; the Trust Code discount is ten percent (10%) of the subscription fee and applies only to subscription charges**, **excluding Sur, Invocation Fees, and Operational Pass-Through Charges, as defined in the EULA. Pricing and applicable taxes are disclosed at checkout. To the extent permitted by law, fees are non-refundable except where stated in the EULA or required by consumer-protection law in your jurisdiction. Fees are charged for access to analytics infrastructure, data processing and platform features and are **not** fees for investment advice, recommendations, or suitability assessments. Prices, billing cycles, and applicable taxes will be disclosed at the point of purchase. Subscriptions renew automatically at the then-current price unless cancelled in accordance with the cancellation procedures described at purchase. To the extent permitted by law, Fees are non-refundable except as stated at purchase or required by consumer-protection law in your jurisdiction.

**18**. **Parameter transparency.** 

Where Analytics (including Compass Score) are displayed, the **active input parameters** (for example, loss-tolerance threshold, horizon, confidence level, and lookback window) will be shown or made readily available adjacent to the output. Analytics are **conditional** upon those parameters and do **not** constitute investment advice, recommendations, predictions, or suitability assessments.

**19\. Compass Score.** 

A **rules-based analytic index (0–10,000)** showing how closely a product aligns with the **parameters selected by the user**. The Score is calculated mechanically and is **identical for anyone using the same inputs at the same time**. It is **not** investment advice, a recommendation, a prediction, or a suitability assessment.

20. **Jurisdictional overlays.**

* **Lead-in.** These jurisdictional notices **summarise and are subordinate** to the territory-specific provisions of the **Member EULA (Schedule A)**. Where there is any overlap or conflict, the EULA controls for Members.
